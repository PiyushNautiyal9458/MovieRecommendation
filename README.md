This repository hosts a simple yet effective movie recommendation system developed using machine learning and cosine similarity. By inputting a movie name, users receive five recommendations based on the similarities in movie genres. The system relies on Python and essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. To use it, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the provided script. The dataset used for recommendation is a subset of the MovieLens dataset, containing movie IDs, titles, and genres. The algorithm computes cosine similarity to gauge the likeness between movies, facilitating accurate recommendations.
